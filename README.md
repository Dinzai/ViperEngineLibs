# ViperEngineLibs
 Open source Viper engine for Game Design 

 This is not a comercial engine

 This version does not include interop with python

 What I am intending to do, is only use SFML for the window handling, key presses, and drawing. 

 I want to avoid using std::vector, or std::list. Basically, I am trying to do things the hard way, 
 for the sake of learning. I do not suggest anyone use this Framework as an 'Engine' to make a game, 
 rather, I challenge you to look into not relying on libaray's just because it is easy. Try to grow,
 make some mistakes, and enjoy the journey. 

 In time I will be making a simple game of snake in this framework as a proof of concept. As a working
 programmer, I will get to it, when I get to it.
